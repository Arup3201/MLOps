# Support Vector Regression

# What is SVR?

# SVR is a type of Support Vector Machine that supports linear and non-linear regression. In SVR, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is the number of features), with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform regression by finding the hyperplane that differentiates the two types of data very well.

# When to use SVR?

# SVR is a good option when the data has non-linear features. It is also a good option when the data has a lot of noise.

# Pros and Cons of SVR

# Pros:

# SVR works well with high-dimensional data.
# SVR works well with noisy data.
# SVR works well with non-linear data.
# SVR works well with data that has a lot of outliers.

# Cons:

# SVR is not suitable for large datasets because of its high training time.
# SVR is not suitable for low-dimensional data.
