# Random Forest Notes

# Random Forest is a type of ensemble learning method, specifically a bagging method.
# Bagging is a method of combining multiple models to increase the overall accuracy of the model.
# Random Forest is a collection of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data.
# The final prediction is the average of all the predictions from all the trees.
# Random Forest is a very powerful algorithm, and is used in many applications, including classification, regression, and clustering.
